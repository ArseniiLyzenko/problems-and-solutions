/*
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is
the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always
exist in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
